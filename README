NAME
    RT-Extension-FeaturedTickets - Generate public web page for featured
    tickets.

DESCRIPTION
    Create a webpage that anyone can view (NoAuth), displaying details on
    featured tickets. A visitor can decide to sign up as a requestor on a
    linked ticket in the same queue. The tickets featured can be selected
    from a queue and limited to their statuses.

Configuration
    Will need to specify two config variables for the extension:

        Set($FeaturedTicketsQueue, 'FeaturedTickets');

    $FeaturedTicketsQueue specifies which queue the featured tickets will be
    loaded from, when the initialdata is loaded the 'FeaturedTickets' queue
    is created by default. Renaming this queue is the simplest way to use
    another queue name but keep the relevant applied custom fields.

        Set($FeaturedTicketStatuses, ['open', ...]);

    $FeaturedTicketStatuses is an array ref, where the ticket statuses that
    will be accepted from the $FeaturedTicketsQueue are specified. Only
    tickets with one of the statuses in the array will be listed on the
    featured page. It is advisable not to use 'new' as an accepted status,
    or sponsored tickets will also be displayed.

        Set($SponsorsQueue, 'Sponsors');

    Lastly need to set which queue new sponsor tickets will be placed into
    with the $SponsorsQueue variable.
