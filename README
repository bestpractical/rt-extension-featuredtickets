DESCRIPTION
    Create a webpage that anyone can view (NoAuth), displaying details on
    featured tickets. A visitor can decide to sign up as a requestor on a
    linked ticket in the same queue. The tickets featured can be selected
    from a queue and limited to their statuses.

CONFIGURATION
    This extension requires settings for a few configuration items to work
    properly.

  $FeaturedTicketsQueue
    $FeaturedTicketsQueue specifies which queue the featured tickets will be
    loaded from. During installation, a queue called 'FeaturedTickets' is
    created by default. Renaming this queue is the simplest way to use
    another queue name but keep the relevant applied custom fields.

        Set($FeaturedTicketsQueue, 'FeaturedTickets');

  $FeaturedTicketStatuses
    $FeaturedTicketStatuses sets the list of tickets statuses of tickets
    that should be displayed on the public page. Only tickets with one of
    the statuses in the array will be shown.

        Set($FeaturedTicketStatuses, ['open', ...]);

  $SponsorsQueue
    When a sponsor signs up for a ticket, a new ticket is created in this
    queue with the new sponsor as the Requestor.

        Set($SponsorsQueue, 'Sponsors');

  Custom Fields
    There are several custom fields that are used to create the content for
    each item on the public page. These are created when you run make
    initdb. Feature Type also needs to be set to see tickets on the public
    page and it defaults to 'RT'.
